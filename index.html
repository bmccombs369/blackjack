            <h1>Blackjack:</h1>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>The object of the game is to beat the dealer by having a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over
                21. Each card is worth it's number with face cards being worth 10 and Aces being worth 11 unless it would
                make you bust, in which case it is worth 1. If you go over 21 you bust and the game is over. If you are dealt
                an opening hand with a count of 21 you have blackjack and win, unless the dealer can match with his opening
                hand. The game begins with you and the dealer being dealt 2 cards. You will go first and can decide to hit
                and try to increase your count, or you can stay and pass the turn to the dealer to see if he can beat your
                count. Good luck!
            </p>
