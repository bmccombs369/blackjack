        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>The object of the game is to beat the dealer by having a count as close to 21 as possible, whithout going over 21.
            Each card is worth it's number with face cards being worth 10 and Aces being worth 11 unless it would make you
            bust, in which case it is worth 1. If you go over 21 you bust and the game is over. If you are dealt an opening
            hand with a count of 21 you have blackjack and win, unless the dealer can match with his opening hand. The game
            begins with you and the dealer being dealt 2 cards. You will go first and can decide to hit and try to increase
            your count, or you can stay and pass the turn to the dealer to see if he can beat your count. Good luck!
