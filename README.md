# Blackjack

## Description

This is my first ever web app. I made it as my first project for my Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. The assignment was to make a game app using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. My strategy was to build all of the game logic and make sure it worked using console logs before adding styling via CSS and DOM manipulation via JavaScript.
