When the button is clicked the player is dealt two cards along with the dealer. The player then decides if they want to hit or stay. Once the player stays, the dealer will try to beat their total.

## Updates

In the second version I want to add betting and betting related abilities such as splitting, insurance, and doubling down. Also I would like to spend more time styling the app.
